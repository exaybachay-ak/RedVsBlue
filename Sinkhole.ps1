<#    #Powershell blackhole script
          Just run this script and it will re-route potentially malicious traffic to null
          In order to verify this, try run a to traceroute to 64.182.208.181 (<-- update this address later)
            Your traceroute should route to null because this software has configured a rule to force specific outbound
            traffic to the localhost bitbucket
          If you want to un-do the changes, select the reverse changes option and it will roll things back.  If something
          went wrong and the rules are "stuck" on, then re-run this script with the -undo switch.  This will go in and
          remove any settings that the script would have implemented, basically by running the script in reverse.
  
      NOTE: At least half of the credit should go to Dave Kennedy and @BinaryDefense for making GoatRider.  
             Although the main component is the idea of re-routing to null, and the ease of use, GoatRider was what brought it all together
